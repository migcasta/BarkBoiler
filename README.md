# BarkBoiler
Transfer Function Process Models from the Bark Boiler at SCA Obbola. 

The models have been created by Wolfgang Birk and first introduced in [1].
Alternative state space models were later introduced by Wolfgang Birk at [2]. 

Files description: 
    - BBmodels.mat includes MATLAB transfer function models.
    - BBLatextSource.tex includes the Latex source files to be used for adding the model to your document. 
    - BBDocumentation.pdf includes a description on the process and some relevant documentation. 
    - BBBibliography.bib is a bibtex file with references for the Bark Boiler. 

To cite this models, please use [1]. 

I recommend to use this repository when using the Bark Boiler models, because there are a large number of parameters and you can make typos implemented them yourself. Notice that I am a co-author of the paper were the models are introduced.
